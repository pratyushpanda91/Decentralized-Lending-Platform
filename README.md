# Crypto Collateralized Lending

This repository contains the Solidity code for a decentralized lending platform that allows users to request and fund loans using cryptocurrency as collateral. The code is designed for testing on Remix with test Ether.

---

## Files in the Repository

- `CryptoCollateralizedLending.sol`: The main smart contract for the lending platform.
- `IERC20.sol`: Interface for ERC20 tokens used as collateral.
- `SafeMath.sol`: Library for secure arithmetic operations.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Remix IDE**:
   - Access [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile, deploy, and interact with the contracts.
2. **Test Ether**:
   - Use the test Ether provided in the Remix JavaScript VM for all interactions.
3. **Environment**:
   - Ensure you are using the Remix JavaScript VM (Berlin) for testing.

---

## Steps to Test the Contract

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### 2. Open Remix IDE
- Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- In the **File Explorer**, create a new folder and upload the following files:
  - `CryptoCollateralizedLending.sol`
  - `IERC20.sol`
  - `SafeMath.sol`

---

### 3. Compile the Contracts
1. Navigate to the **Solidity Compiler** tab in Remix.
2. Select `0.8.19` as the Solidity compiler version to match the pragma directive.
3. Compile the main contract: `CryptoCollateralizedLending.sol`.

---

### 4. Deploy the Contract
1. Switch to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab.
2. Use the `JavaScript VM (Berlin)` environment for testing.
3. Deploy the `CryptoCollateralizedLending` contract.
4. Once deployed, the contract will appear under the **Deployed Contracts** section.

---

### 5. Test the Contract

#### Add Funds to the Lending Platform
1. In the **Deployed Contracts** section, locate the `addFunds()` function.
2. Enter an amount of test Ether to deposit (e.g., `1 Ether`).
3. Click the **Transact** button and confirm the transaction.

#### Request a Loan
1. Use the `requestLoanWithCollateral()` function.
2. Parameters:
   - Loan amount in Ether (e.g., `0.5 Ether`).
   - Address of the collateral token (e.g., the address of an ERC20 token contract if available).
   - Collateral amount (e.g., `2` units of the collateral token).
3. Submit the transaction and verify the loan creation using the `loans` mapping.

#### Fund a Loan
1. Call the `fundLoan()` function with the borrowerâ€™s address.
2. Confirm the transaction.
3. Verify the loan is funded by checking its state.

#### Repay a Loan
1. Use the `repayLoan()` function to repay the loan.
2. Verify the loan state changes to `Repaid` and the collateral is returned.

#### Liquidate Defaulted Loan
1. After the loan becomes overdue, use the `liquidateCollateral()` function with the borrower's address.
2. Verify the loan state changes to `Defaulted`.

## Additional Notes

- **Interest Rate**: Fixed at 2%.
- **Overdue Period**: 1 minute (for testing purposes).
- **Testing Tokens**: Use dummy values or deploy a test ERC20 token if needed for collateral testing.
